<h2>About the app</h2>
<p>In late 2016 I had the good fortune to spend 2 weeks studying and practicing with Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga teacher John Scott where he emphasised to us the importance of the Vinyasa Count as tought to him by Shri K Pattabhi Jois.</p>

<p>Vinyasa is the coordination of breath with movement. The Vinyasa Count is a system of counting, in Sanskrit, each choreographed movement and breath.</p>

<p>Each Vinyasa is to be mentally counted and meditated upon like the beads of a mala. The count becomes a resting place for the mind and a tool for developing deeper levels of focus and awareness. John Scott calls this system the Transcendental Ashtanga Vinyasa Counted Method as ultimately it is a method for transcending our individual differences and achiving a state of Yoga.</p>

<p>Samasthiti.me is designed to help make learning the coreography and count a little bit easier. On the left you will see each Vinyasa along with its numerical and Sanskrit count. To see the pronunciation of the sanskrit, click the Vinyasa photo.</p>

<p>The images on the right are the most recent images on Flickr that have been tagged with the posture name, pulled from the flickr API</p>
